## Quick Start

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/SyedAakif/CSL_Bootcamp.git`

#### <i>Prerequisites</i>
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.js®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js
[**Angular 15**](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) requires `Node.js` LTS version `^14.20` or `^16.13` or `^18.10`.

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI
Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installation

``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Basic usage

``` bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:4200
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```
## What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:
